<h1>MiniJava compiler: Compilers Project Spring 2012 - Tuomas Tynkkynen</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    MiniLang implements an compiler for the <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/vihavain/k12/compiler_project/project/minijavasyntax.html">MiniJava</a> programming language with a few additional features:
    <ul>
        <li>The missing comparison operators '&lt;=', '&gt;=', '!=' and an unary '-' operator</li>
        <li>The null reference constant</li>
        <li>The '=' operator is an expression, not a statement</li>
        <li>The print statement can print other types as well, or print just a newline</li>
        <li>The main method can be located in any class, not just the first one in the file. Also, the class can contain other declarations besides the main method.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
    <h3>Building</h3>
        Use Visual Studio to build the project. Use the <code>build_parser.cmd</code> script to rebuild the Scanner and Parser with gplex and gppg if you modify them.
		<font color="red">For some stupid reason, the unit tests don't seem to work if the project is on the Linux network share in department machines, see
		<a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/pl-PL/vsunittest/thread/e7c23909-b0b0-4d5a-b463-fceced8f5cd8">here</a>.</font>
    <h3>Running</h3>
        Run <code>MiniJava &lt;codefile.mj&gt;</code> to execute a file.
        Run <code>MiniJava</code> without any arguments to see additional command line options.
    <h3>Testing process</h3>
        Majority of testing is done with Visual Studio unit tests, which are contained in the Tests subproject.
    <h4>Code file test cases</h4>
        The Tests\DriverTests folder contains some testcases as .mj files, as well as files with .out, and .err extensions.
        The DriverTest test class compiles each .mj file, and attempts to run the final binary.
        After executing, the standard output (where the 'println' statements print) and standard error (where the compile and runtime errors go) are compared with the .out and .err files.

<h2>Token language</h2>
    Each of the Operator, Keyword and Punctuation have their own token types and productions in the gplex pattern definitions.
    The 'Dim' token is required to keep the grammar LALR(1).
    This is required to distinguish an array declaration (<code>Foo[] foos;</code>) and e.g. array assignment (<code>Foo[bar] = baz;</code>).
    Without it, the parser would complain about a reduce/reduce conflict.

	The following listing is a bit simplified from the actual rules, it does not contain the details of illegal character handling, or skipping comment contents.
<pre>
Operator ::= "&lt;=" | "&lt;" | "&gt;=' | "&gt;' | "==" | "!=" | 
             "=" | "!" | "||" | "&amp;&amp;" |
             "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%" |
Punctuation ::=  "," | ";" | "." | 
                 "(" | ")" | "[" | "]" | "{" | "}"
Dim ::= "[" Whitespace<sub>opt</sub> "]"

Keyword ::= "assert" | "boolean" | "class" | "extends" | "else" | "false" |
            "if" | "int" | "length" | "main" | "new" | "null" | "out" |
            "println" | "public" | "return" | "static" | "System" |
            "this" | "true" | "void" | "while"
IntLiteral ::= [0-9]+
Identifier ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*

Whitespace ::= [ \t\r\n\f\v]+
EolComment ::= "//" [^\n]* "\n"
CommentStart ::= "/*"
</pre>
When a Comment token is found, the Comment state is entered, and only the following patterns are then considered.
Every CommentStart and CommentEnd token found in this state will respectively increment and decrement the comment nesting counter.
When the counter reaches zero, the lexer enters its regular state again.
The CommentContent tokens are simply ignored.
<pre>
CommentContent ::= any string not containing "/*" or "*/"
CommentStart ::= "/*"
CommentEnd ::= "*/"
</pre>
<h3>Grammar</h3>
The parser is generated by gppg. The grammar has one shift-reduce conflict, the classic 'dangling else' problem.
The default resolution gives the correct semantics.

<p>Here, the terminal tokens are written in <code>UpperCase</code>, or one-character tokens like this: <code>'+'</code>.</p>

<h2>Error handling strategies</h2>
        <h3>Generic</h3>
        The CompilerContext class has a list of CompileError objects, which represents the errors encountered
        CompileError contains a diagnostic message, location of the error, and possibly an another location and message.
        For example, if an already declared variable is redeclared, the CompileError will point to both the erroneous declaration and the original declaration.
        <h3>Parse error recovery</h3>
            The following cases have special handling in addition to causing an error message.
            <ul>
                <li>An unrecognized or a non-ASCII character was found: just ignore the characters. In addition, additional diagnostics about this error are suppressed for the remaining of this line.</li>
                <li>Error while parsing a statement or expression: skip until next semicolon. This is done with an error rule in the gppg grammar.</li>
				<li>A duplicate class, field, method or local variable is found: rename it to some noncolliding name, and keep going.</li>
            </ul>

<h2>Program code documentation</h2>
    The MiniLang solution contains the following Visual Studio projects:
    <dl>
        <dt>Tests</dt>
            <dd>This project contains the unit tests for the compiler.</dd>
        <dt>MiniJava</dt>
            <dd>This project contains the core of the compiler.</dd>
    </dl>
	In addition, the parser and the scanner are implemented with gppg and gplex. They are located in parser.y and scanner.l which are in the top level directory. If those files are modified, the build_parser.cmd script must be run to regenerate GeneratedParser.cs and Scanner.cs.
        <h3>MiniJava core classes</h3>
        <img src="MainClassDiagram.png"/>
        <img src="DataModelDiagram.png"/>
        <dl>
            <dt>Location</dt><dd>Represents a location in a source file. A location can span multiple characters and lines. Has associated starting and ending line and column numbers, as well as byte offsets into the file.</dd>

					<li>JavaArrayType: represents an array of some other type. Contains a reference to a JavaType instance of the base type.</li>
					<li>NullReferenceType: represents the type of the <code>null</code> literal. This requires a special type, since the null value is assignable to any reference type.</li>
